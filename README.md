# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a project designed to enhance road safety by monitoring driver behavior and detecting signs of drowsiness in real-time. This system aims to prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue by providing timely alerts.

Key Features:
Real-Time Monitoring:
Utilizes a webcam or in-vehicle camera to continuously monitor the driver's face and eyes.

Facial Recognition:
Employs advanced facial recognition algorithms to detect and analyze facial landmarks, focusing on eye movements and blinking patterns.

Drowsiness Detection:
Identifies signs of drowsiness based on eye closure duration, blinking frequency, and head position, using machine learning models trained on diverse datasets.

Alerts and Notifications:
Provides audible and visual alerts to the driver when signs of drowsiness are detected, prompting them to take a break or rest.

User-Friendly Interface:
Features a simple and intuitive interface for easy setup and monitoring, suitable for both personal and commercial use.

Technologies Used:
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: OpenCV for image processing, Dlib for facial landmark detection, and TensorFlow/Keras for machine learning.
Hardware: Standard webcam or in-vehicle camera system.
Other Tools: NumPy, Scipy, and various data preprocessing tools.
Project Goals:
To reduce the risk of road accidents caused by driver fatigue.
To provide an affordable and effective solution for both personal and commercial vehicles.
To contribute to the advancement of driver safety technologies through open-source collaboration and innovation.
